Setup

|                   |              |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| distro            | arch         |
| window manager    | i3-gaps      |
| terminal emulator | urxvt        |
| editor            | neovim       |

Goals
* Invisible desktop environment without any icons or floating windows
* bash and i3 customized to use vi keyboard shortcuts
* Keybindings inspired by [ADM-3A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A#Legacy): no arrows and ctrl in place of caps lock
* Solarized Dark theme shared across i3, urxvt, vi, and chromium
